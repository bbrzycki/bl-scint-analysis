Installation
============

You can use :code:`pip` to install the package automatically:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install blscint
    
Alternately, you can clone the repository and install it directly. Since the codebase
is under active development, this is the best way to get the most recent updates.

At the command line, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:bbrzycki/blscint.git
    python setup.py install
