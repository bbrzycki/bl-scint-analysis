Analysis code for detecting ISM scintillation in detected narrowband radio signals

---

This library provides methods for probing the presence of strong ISM scintillation in detected narrowband radio signals as a method of analyzing technosignatures. There are a few main sections: scintillation timescale estimation using NE2001 (Cordes & Lazio 2002), scintillated intensity time series synthesis, and statistical analysis of intensity time series (for characterizing local RFI and filtering technosignature candidates).
